When we are using a web browser to go to our favorite web site, the web browser is the program and it presents to us text, pictures, and video.  In a word processing program, the program output is the document you are typing.  For a command-line program, like what we'll see in this tutorial, the program shows plain text.\n",

The important lesson here is that in order for Python to print your text, i.e., one or more characters, also known as a string, we must tell Python where the string starts and stops.  We do this by surrounding the characters with either a single quote, e.g., 'this is a string' or a doule quote, e.g., \"this is also a string\".  We'll learn more about quoting when we discuss strings.  For now, just understand that to print a sequence of characters using print all of the characters must be single quoted or double quoted.**\n",
